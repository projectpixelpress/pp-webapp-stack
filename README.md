## Pixel Press Web App Stack

A basic scaffolding for all Pixel Press webapps.

### Setup:

Requires node, npm and bower installed globally

Also a good idea to have LiveReload chrome extension installed and running

`(sudo) npm install -g grunt-cli bower browserify` - make sure you have grunt, browserify and bower installed 

`npm install` - install node modules

`bower install` - install client components

`grunt scaffold` - copy and build client directories/files

`grunt` - watch directories and live reloading in the browser

`npm start` - start the node server

Now hit http://localhost:3000 in your browser
